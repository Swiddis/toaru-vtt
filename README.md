# Toaru VTT

Toaru is a Virtual Tabletop (VTT) specializing in card-heavy tabletop games that
demand a flexible table layout, such as:
[*The Quiet Year*](https://buriedwithoutceremony.com/the-quiet-year),
[*i'm sorry did you say street magic*](https://seaexcursion.itch.io/street-magic), or
[*Dialect*](https://thornygames.com/pages/dialect).

## Motivation

There are a lot of virtual tabletops, and a lot of them spend great effort
implementing several complex game-specific mechanics. This works great for games
with the budget or playerbase to have assets custom-built for it, but there are
lots of great tabletop games that really demand little more than a canvas and
some standard materials. In the words of a friend:

> ...Could I just have a dicebot attatched to a virtual whiteboard?

This project is an attempt to make a dicebot attached to a virtual whiteboard.
With cards.
